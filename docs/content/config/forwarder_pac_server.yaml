#
# TLS private key to use if the server protocol is https or h2. Can be a path to

# --- Proxy options ---

#
# Proxy Auto-Configuration file to use for upstream proxy selection. It can be a

# --- DNS options ---

#
# If more than one DNS server is specified with the --dns-server flag, passing
# this flag will enable round-robin selection.

#
# DNS server(s) to use instead of system default. There are two execution
# policies, when more then one server is specified. Fallback: the first server

# servers are used in a round-robin fashion. The port is optional, if not
# specified the default port is 53.

# Timeout for dialing DNS servers. Only used if DNS servers are specified.
