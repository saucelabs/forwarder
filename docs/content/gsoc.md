# Google Summer of Code

## Introduction

Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is a global program focused on bringing more student developers into open-source software development.
Students work with an open source organization on a 12-week programming project during their break from school.

Take a look at the [official GSoC website](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) for more information.

## Forwarder's Participation

Forwarder is participating in GSoC 2024.
We are looking for students who are passionate about open source and want to contribute to the project.

## Ideas

We have a list of project ideas that we think would be beneficial for the project.
However, we are open to new ideas as well.
If you have a project idea that you think would be beneficial for the project, feel free to reach out to us.

### Project Ideas

#### Wireguard integration in Forwarder proxy

The goal of this project is to incorporate a WireGuard Server into the Forwarder proxy.
This integration aims to significantly streamline and enhance mobile device integration with Forwarder.
MITMproxy added a similar feature in October 2022, see [here](https://mitmproxy.org/posts/wireguard-mode/) for more information.

Our implementation, can be more integrated and robust. 
Utilizing [Go WireGuard](https://github.com/WireGuard/wireguard-go), extensively used by entities like TailScale, we will seamlessly integrate it directly into the Forwarder proxy. This approach not only ensures better performance but also optimizes the overall usage of the proxy.

#### HTTP/3 MITM support in Forwarder proxy

HTTP/3 is the next version of the HTTP protocol and is designed to improve the performance of web traffic.
This project aims to add support for HTTP/3 in the Forwarder proxy, including MITM support.
